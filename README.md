## ü§ñ How It Works
This application builds upon advanced frameworks to deliver a superior user experience with a wealth of options:

**Recording**: When you press F8 to start recording, the application listens to mouse and keyboard actions and logs the events with timestamps. These interactions are stored in a structured list for playback.

**Playback**: Pressing F9 starts the playback loop. The application reads the recorded events, calculates the intervals between actions, and simulates the recorded mouse movements and keyboard presses accordingly.

**Managing Recordings**:

- **Start/Stop recording by pressing F8**: Actions during recording are logged.
- **Start/Stop playback by pressing F9**: The recorded actions are replayed in random order.
- **Delete Recording**: Select a recording and delete it, or delete all recordings at once.
- **Save/Load Recordings**: Use the File menu to save recordings to a file or load them from a file.
- **Playback Speed**: Adjust the playback speed using the slider provided in the interface.
